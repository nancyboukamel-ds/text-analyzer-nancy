Hello, world! Welcome to 2026 — where prompts ship faster than code.
This is a simple test. Or is it?

AI is fun; AI is useful. But AI isn't magic.
In 2026, we build LLM apps, RAG pipelines, and agents.

Agents use tools. Tools call APIs?
APIs rate-limit (429)! Timeouts happen... so we retry, log, and move on.

Here are some spicy edge cases for your tokenizer:
- Numbers: 2, 10, 3.14, and 1e-3 are tokens (maybe).
- Hyphenated words: end-to-end, prompt-injection, tool-calling, and real-world.
- Contractions: don't, can't, it's, we're, you'll.
- MixedCase: OpenAI, LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI, GitHub.
- Symbols: $100, 50%, #hashtags, and @handles.

RAG time:
We chunk docs. We embed vectors. We retrieve top-k.
Then we rerank, cite sources, and avoid hallucinations!

Tool calling 101:
Agent -> planner -> tool -> observation -> answer.
Stop conditions matter. Budgets matter. Loops are real.

Links and “PII-like” strings:
Email: hello@example.com
Docs: https://example.com/docs
Ticket: INC-2026-00042

Repeat test: repeat repeat repeat.
Repeat again: AI AI AI... and again—AI!

Final check: Are you counting sentences correctly? Great :)
Now ship your function, push to GitHub, and don't forget the README!

Regards,
Abdo Kamar.
